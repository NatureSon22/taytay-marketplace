      "Welcome to E-Tiangge Portal, an online marketplace that showcases the best of Taytay's Garments and Fashion. Originally created to bring the vibrant and affordable Ready-to-Wear (RTW) clothing and accessories from Taytay’s famous Tiangge (market) to the digital world, we have worked hard to adapt and evolve in response to new challenges. Our mission is to provide a platform where local Taytay sellers can easily showcase their high-quality garments to a wider audience, while helping the Taytayeños thrive during difficult times, especially through the COVID-19 pandemic. As Taytay is known as the Garments Capital of the Philippines, we aim to make it easier for people everywhere to access and buy affordable yet fashionable clothing, textiles, and accessories. At E-Tiangge Portal, we believe in supporting local businesses, promoting the unique craftsmanship of Taytay's garment industry, and providing a space for people to shop with ease.",

      "For the past several years, people from Taytay Rizal are already into textile and RTW (ready-to-wear) businesses in which garments are being sold in Divisoria, Baclaran, Tutuban, Greenhills and every part of the Philippines. Thanks to an initiative by the local Taytay government in 2014, Taytay-based tailors and dressmakers who used to rent space outside Taytay Rizal now have a more conducive business location right in their hometown. Few stalls started in a small lot of Club Manila East Compound. It gradually grew and continuously growing. As of 2017, there are around 10 garments center operating in Club Manila East Compound. Each garment center has hundreds to thousands of stalls selling different clothes. Of these ten, the biggest are Taytay Municipal Tiangge, Bagpi Garment Center, Igpai Garment Center, MASUERTE 4JC Tiangge and Freedom bazaar. Each center has varying schedule of opening and closing but almost all are open on main market days of Monday and Thursday evenings.",
      "Since then, the Taytay Tiangge has become a shopper’s paradise and a godsend for wholesalers. However, due to the ever growing businesses of Taytay Tiangge, there are some drawbacks and one worth mentioning is the traffic. For peak hours, the traffic stretches from Taytay Tiangge (Club Manila East) up to Ortigas Ave in Pasig City.",
